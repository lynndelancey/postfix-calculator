📬 Postfix Calculator
A simple Java-based calculator that evaluates arithmetic expressions written in postfix (Reverse Polish) notation. Supports basic operations and includes error handling for invalid expressions.

🚀 Features
✅ Supports multi-digit operands

➕ Handles +, -, *, /, and % operators

⚠️ Detects and reports invalid expressions

📂 Reads and evaluates expressions from a text file

🧠 How It Works
The calculator uses a stack to evaluate postfix expressions. Operands are pushed onto the stack, and operators pop the top two values to compute the result.

📄 Sample Usage
java
PostfixCalculator calculator = new PostfixCalculator();

System.out.println("Result 1: " + calculator.evaluatePostfix("42*3+")); // Output: 11
System.out.println("Result 2: " + calculator.evaluatePostfix("53+7*")); // Output: 56
System.out.println("Result 3: " + calculator.evaluatePostfix("42*+"));  // Output: Error
📁 File Input
To evaluate expressions from a file:

java
calculator.evaluateFromFile("expressions.txt");
Each line in expressions.txt should contain a single postfix expression.
